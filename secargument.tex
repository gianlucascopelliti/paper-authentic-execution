\section{Formal Definition and Proof of Security Properties}

In this appendix we focus on defining a simple reactive
programming language for our architecture, the formal semantics of that
programming language, and the formal definition and proof of the security
properties of our approach
(\cref{sec:secprops,sec:semantics,sec:proofs}).
