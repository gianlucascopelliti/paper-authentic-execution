\section{Summary \& Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

In this article, we present a software architecture to securely execute
distributed applications on shared, heterogeneous \ac{TEE}-infrastructures. We
have extended Sancus, a light-weight embedded \ac{TEE} with support for secure
I/O, interfaced it with the commercial of-the-shelf \acp{TEE} ARM TrustZone and
Intel SGX, and implemented and evaluated a software development framework which
enables the execution of reactive (event-driven) distributed applications on a
shared infrastructure with strong authenticity guarantees and in the presence of
capable attackers, while relying on a very small TCB. We have implemented (and
foresee many more) compelling use cases in IoT and control systems.  While much
of our work is focused on small embedded microprocessors, we demonstrate that
our solution to be generally applicable to, e.g., build secure distributed
applications that integrate IoT sensing and actuation with cloud-based data
processing or aggregation.  Yet, implementing secure I/O is more challenging on
non-embedded architectures.  Extensions to our work would be to strengthen
security guarantees while maintaining a small TCB, fully integrating a notion of
availability based on~\cite{alder_2021_aion}, and to formalize the security
argument using recently proposed logics (e.g., \cite{warinschi}) for reasoning
about \acp{TEE}.
